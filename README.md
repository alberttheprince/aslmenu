# ASL Menu 

FiveM's first open-source American Sign Language (ASL) menu for using ASL in FiveM! 

This is intended as a method for practicing ASL, utilizing it in FiveM, and creating a fun, interactive way for ASL users to use ASL in FiveM. All signs and animations are community-contributed. Thank you!

This menu is focused on ASL, while we'd like to provide support for all sign languages. Please make sure your contributions are accurate to real examples of ASL.

If you'd like to contribute, please use a popular, available ASL reference such as [https://www.lifeprint.com/](https://www.lifeprint.com/) when creating a new animation. Include your reference so that we can validate contributions.

# Features:
- Accurate ASL Letters (A-Z)
- Accurate ASL numbers (0-9)
